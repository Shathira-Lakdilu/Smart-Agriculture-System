Welcome to our Smart Agriculture System GitHub repository! 🌱 This comprehensive project is designed to revolutionize agriculture by combining two vital components: Greenhouse Monitoring and Field Monitoring. Our solution provides farmers with a sophisticated yet user-friendly system for optimizing crop conditions in both controlled environments and remote fields. Explore each part of our project:

## 1. Greenhouse Monitoring and Controlling 🏡

Our Greenhouse Monitoring module focuses on creating an interconnected network of greenhouses using Wi-Fi technology. Here's what it offers:

-   🌍 **Networked Greenhouses:** Connect multiple greenhouses to a central Raspberry Pi hub over Wi-Fi, enabling centralized control and monitoring.
    
-   🌡️ **Environmental Sensors:** Utilize sensors for temperature, humidity, and other key parameters to ensure optimal greenhouse conditions.
    
-   🌐 **Dashboard Interface:** Access a farmer-friendly dashboard for real-time insights into each greenhouse's environmental status.
    
-   📊 **Control Mechanisms:** Implement automated control mechanisms for factors like irrigation, ventilation, and lighting to optimize crop growth.
    

## 2. Field Monitoring and Controlling 🚜

The Field Monitoring module extends our system to remote fields, overcoming connectivity challenges. Here's what it includes:

-   🌱 **LoRa Connectivity:** Use LoRa (SX1278 module) for remote field communication, ensuring reliable data transmission in areas with limited Wi-Fi coverage.
    
-   🌧️ **Moisture Sensors:** Deploy moisture sensors in the field to gather crucial soil moisture data for informed irrigation decisions.
    
-   📡 **Integration with Raspberry Pi Hub:** Connect field sensors to the central Raspberry Pi hub, aggregating data for a holistic view of the agricultural landscape.
    
-   🚀 **Precision Agriculture:** Empower farmers with data-driven insights to make informed decisions for optimizing crop yield and resource efficiency.

  ## The key features
Our automated greenhouse is a cutting-edge solution for precision agriculture. It incorporates a range of essential components to optimize crop growth and environmental conditions. The key features include:

🌧️ **Environmental Monitoring:**

-   DHT11 Sensor: Measures humidity and temperature.
-   Soil Moisture Sensor: Monitors soil moisture levels.
-   BH1750 Ambient Light Sensor: Measures lux value for precise light intensity control.

🧠 **Control Hub:**

-   ESP32 Microcontroller: Powers the greenhouse automation, collecting and processing data from the sensors.

⚙️ **Parameter Control Modules:**

-   Solenoid Valve: Manages irrigation to ensure optimal soil moisture.
-   LED Grow Lights: Adjusts lighting conditions for different growth stages.
-   Exhaust Fan: Regulates temperature and humidity levels by activating the exhaust system.

🌡️ **Automated Regulation:** Our program facilitates the automatic regulation of the greenhouse environment:

-   **Temperature Control:** The exhaust fan is activated to maintain the desired temperature.
-   **Humidity Control:** The exhaust fan contributes to humidity regulation.
-   **Soil Moisture Management:** The solenoid water valve ensures optimal soil moisture levels.
-   **Lighting Adjustment:** LED grow lights are dynamically controlled to achieve the desired light intensity.
